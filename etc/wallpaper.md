## wallpaper

Do you like to change wallpaper? How many wallpapers do you have?

I'm trying to collecte favourite and nice samples. Right now there are about 450 items. However I prefer to use particular one across all machines that I'm using. Probably it gives ability to fill some extra comfort. Also I change favourite sample very rare. Thanks goodness there is only one smartphone. Best option for this device is changing even more rare. The same thing applicable for ringtone and notification sound. A lot of times I tried to adopt something new but almost everything were rejected.

What does it all means? Probably, it means that humans taste is changing over time, but this process in slow in general. We need to try something new because something really good could be missed in opposite case.
