## minikube

Recently I took part in an intensive course "k8s for developers" made by slurm.io and it was awesome. Before it I had only passive knowledge in this area, only once tried to connect to pod via kubectl, but the general idea in first approximation was almost clear. After it I have quite a good understanding of what's going on and a lot of practice experience. Thatâ€™s great!

Right now I intend to dig a bit deeper and find a few more answers for questions related to k8s and minikube in particular.

k8s:
1. What is **RBAC**?
2. **Role** and **ClusterRole**?
3. **RoleBindings** and **ClusterRoleBinding**?
4. **ServiceAccount**?

minikube:
1. What is **ingress** addon?
2. What is **ingress-dns** addon?
3. Does **nginx ingress** pre-installed or pre-configured?
4. Does **nginx ingress** has admin UI?
5. Does **traefik ingress** work only via **RBAC**?
6. How to use latest version of **traefik ingress**?
7. Why RAM and CPU limits are not applicable?
