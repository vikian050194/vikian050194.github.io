## sources of knowledge

It seems I no longer need to watch courses. Finally my knowledge base has "critical mass" and intuition based on experience works fine at least in general cases.

Of course I need to continue knowledge mining without significant breaks (in opposite case brain would be hungry). But articles and books are suitable for this purpose more. I realized it recently when I had been trying to finish *JavaScript Objects, Prototypes, and Classes* by Jim Cooper few weeks in a row. In fact this course about one and a half hour, but it was finished in 3 weeks. Content is good, speaker is good, but something is wrong. I need to go deeper. And it's like read a book and watch a film. Even if film is great, original book is 10 times better.

Historically courses was almost the main source of fundamental and systematized information because my reading speed was slow. Quality is good and it covers a lot in a short period of time because of balance of included and missed details.

At university I didn't finished Andrew Troelsen book and coped with 120 pages or so. *CLR via C#* by Jeffrey Richter was not even started. Courses, learn-by-doing (a lot of pet-projects) and lerning of particular topics "on-demand" were my way to become a middle full stack developer. Quite good result, is not it?
