This is my personal tech diary or something like that. Probably it will include non tech notes as well.

Just for now it's a pure Markdown that converted to HTML by some GitHub automatic engine on the fly.

~~All notes are grouped according to topic~~

All notes are listed here and I'll try to group it by topic later (may be).

1. [book and film](book_and_film.md)
2. [wallpaper](wallpaper.md)
3. [equality](javascript/equality.md), [property descriptor](javascript/property_descriptor.md) and [inheritance](javascript/inheritance.md) in JavaScript
4. [fast and furious](fast_and_furious.md)
5. [engineer](engineer.md)
